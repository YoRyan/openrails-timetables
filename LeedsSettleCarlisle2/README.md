# Leeds, Settle & Carlisle v2

Run contemporary passenger services on Renzo Grassi's
[Leeds, Settle & Carlisle route](http://www.ildeposito.net/Files/Scenari/LeSeCa2.htm),
an extended and upgraded version of the Settle & Carlisle route that came with
MSTS. This timetable includes all of Northern's Route 7 services between Leeds
and Carlisle as of December 2019.

#### Timetables

* [Northern](https://web.archive.org/web/20191120001057/https://d2cf7kiw5xizhy.cloudfront.net/images/timetables/bucket/leeds-to-carlisle-leeds-to-morecambe-heysham-port-2442.pdf)

#### Errata

* The route lacks proper platform markers at the Leeds terminal, and it also
  omits the modern east-west platforms at Shipley. All northbound trains spawn
  at Leeds and have 18 minutes to reach Bingley, the first modelled stop.
* The speed limit has been reduced to 60mph, which is prototypical for modern
  operations.
